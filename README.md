This repo is dealing with instance segmentation. We used PixelLib, a python library used for easy implementation of semantic and instance segmentation of objects in images and videos.Instance segmentation in this case has been implemented on image, webcam and uploaded video. Results for image and upload videos instance segmentation are saved.
